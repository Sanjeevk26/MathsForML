    "### Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a way to decompose a matrix into constituent parts. It is a more general form of the eigendecomposition. While the eigendecomposition is limited to square matrices, the singular value decomposition can be applied to non-square matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD of matrix $A$ is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$A = UDV^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where: \n",
    "\n",
    "* $U$ is an orthogonal $m \\times m$ matrix; its columns are the **left-singular vectors** of $A$.\n",
    "* $V$ is an orthogonal $n \\times n$ matrix; its columns are the **right-singular vectors** of $A$.\n",
    "* $D$ is a diagonal $m \\times n$ matrix; elements along its diagonal are the **singular values** of $A$."
